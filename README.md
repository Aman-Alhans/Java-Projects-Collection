# Java-Projects-Collection
Description:
A comprehensive collection of Java projects covering Core Java, OOP concepts, Design Patterns, RESTful APIs, Selenium automation, TestNG, Cucumber (BDD), and Spring Boot. Built for hands-on learning, interview preparation, and real-world application development.

Summary:
This repository is a comprehensive collection of Java-based projects developed as part of hands-on learning, academic practice, and professional skill-building. The projects are organized as an Eclipse workspace and cover a wide range of concepts including Core Java, Object-Oriented Programming, Design Patterns, RESTful APIs, Automation Testing, BDD, and Test Frameworks.

The repository demonstrates progressive learning, starting from Java fundamentals and moving towards real-world backend services, automation frameworks, and design pattern implementations.

-> Project Categories & Highlights
1. Core Java & OOP Fundamentals

These projects focus on building strong foundations in Java programming and object-oriented principles:

Classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation

Collections, sorting, and data handling

Practical problem-solving using Java

Examples:

basic

SortingCustomerOrders

UserDetails

ContactBook

AddressBook

TaskManagementSystem

2. Design Patterns (GoF)

Multiple projects demonstrate Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, each implemented as a standalone example with clean structure and reusable logic.

Implemented patterns include:

Singleton Pattern

Builder Pattern

Adapter Pattern

Decorator Pattern

Strategy Pattern

Command Pattern

Proxy Pattern

Projects:

3. RESTful API Development

Backend services built using Spring Boot and REST principles, focusing on:

REST endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)

API best practices

Projects:

bookstoreapi

RestAssuredHotelRoomService_GET

These projects reflect industry-style backend development, suitable for integration and testing.

4. Automation Testing (Selenium & TestNG)

Several projects focus on test automation frameworks and UI testing:

Selenium WebDriver integration

TestNG annotations, grouping, priorities, and dependencies

Data-driven testing

Test execution and reporting

Projects:

Selenium

SeleniumExtentReport

TestNGAssertions

TestNGAnnotationandGrouping

TestNGAnnotationWithPriorityanddependsOnMethods

CommodityDetails-TestNGDataproviderwithXML

5. BDD & Cucumber Frameworks

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is demonstrated using Cucumber + TestNG:

Feature files written in Gherkin

Step definitions in Java

Hooks and parameterization

Integration with TestNG

Projects:

cucumberproject

CucumberWithTestNGParam

UsageOfHook

These projects show industry-standard BDD practices used in agile teams.

6. Data Handling & External Integration

Projects that focus on working with external data sources and utilities:

Reading Excel data using Apache POI

Data-driven test execution

File-based input handling

Projects:

ApplyingPOI-ReadDatafromExcel

7. Academic & Practical Implementations

Some projects were built as part of academic practical files and training programs, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with implementation:

ADSA_Practical_File

SmartUniversityProfessorPortal

RentACar

PurchaseAppiframe

These projects simulate real-world problem statements and workflows.
